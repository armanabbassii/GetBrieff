        description: [
          "When it comes to end-to-end (E2E) testing, integrating API endpoints can significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of your tests. By using API endpoints to create and retrieve data",
          "you can ensure that your tests are both comprehensive and maintainable. This approach offers several key benefits:"
        //   "Data Setup and Teardown: API endpoints allow you to programmatically set up and tear down test data, ensuring that your E2E tests are not dependent on pre-existing data in your database. This makes your tests more reliable and easier to maintain.",
        //   "Consistency and Speed: Creating data via API endpoints ensures consistency across different test runs. It also speeds up the test execution by avoiding manual data entry through the UI, which can be time-consuming and error-prone."
